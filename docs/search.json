    "text": "3. Handling competing risks\nConsistent with the strategies for addressing intercurrent events [1], an alternative to the hypothetical strategy (targeted by 1-KM estimator) is to:\n\n\nCreate a single composite event,\ne.g., any cause of graft failure is considered an event. This changes the question/estimand [3].\nRestricting inference to the principal stratum,\ne.g., evaluate the effect only in patients who would not experience early HAT (e.g., within the first 48 hours) regardless of the assigned treatment. This needs a “challenging” counterfactual [3].\nApply the treatment policy strategy.\nIn this case it may lead to clinically nonsensical scenarios, e.g., consider the “re-transplant” problem.\nFollow a while-on-treatment strategy,\ne.g., consider the “re-transplant” problem again. This is what the Fine-Gray [F&G, 4] and Jeong-Fine [J&F, 5, 6] estimators attempt to model.\n\n\n\n\nCreate a single composite event, eliminates the competing events, but fundamentally changes the causal question (estimand) [3]\nRestricting inference to the principal stratum, This approach targets a specific subpopulation effect (e.g., the local average effect or LATE), which makes both interpretation and valid estimation especially challenging [3].\nApply the treatment policy strategy. e.g., the “re-transplant” problem: if a patient receives a second transplant due to early HAT, and the second liver is rejected due to OR, the strategy could attribute this rejection to the first liver’s treatment, because the strategy requires that you follow the patient until you see the event of interest.\nFollow a while-on-treatment strategy, e.g., in the “re-transplant” problem, if a patient receives a second transplant due to early HAT, the strategy would evaluate the risk of graft failure due to OR only while the patient still has their first graft, “stopping the clock” at the moment of re-transplant."
